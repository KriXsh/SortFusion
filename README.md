## SortFusion
SortFusion is a web application that visualizes various sorting algorithms. It allows users to input an array of numbers and see step-by-step how different sorting algorithms sort the array. The application also provides a graphical representation to make it easier to understand the sorting process.
                             
## Features
Visualize different sorting algorithms.
Graphical representation of sorting steps.     
User-friendly interface.
Supports Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Heap Sort, Insertion Sort, and Tree Sort.      
Technologies Used
React.js for the front-end.
Node.js and Express.js for the back-end.
Particles.js for the background particle effect.
Axios for API requests.
Joi for input validation.

## Sorting Algorithms
- Merge Sort
Time Complexity: O(n log n)
Space Complexity: O(n)
Description: Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the array into smaller subarrays, sorts them, and then merges them back together.

- Quick Sort
Time Complexity: O(n log n) on average
Space Complexity: O(log n)
Description: Quick Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a pivot element, partitions the array, and recursively sorts the subarrays.

- Bubble Sort
Time Complexity: O(n^2)
Space Complexity: O(1)
Description: Bubble Sort repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

- Selection Sort
Time Complexity: O(n^2)
Space Complexity: O(1)
Description: Selection Sort divides the array into a sorted and an unsorted region, repeatedly selecting the smallest element from the unsorted region and moving it to the sorted region.

- Heap Sort
Time Complexity: O(n log n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
Description: Heap Sort converts the array into a binary heap structure and then repeatedly extracts the maximum element to build the sorted array.

- Insertion Sort
Time Complexity: O(n^2)
Space Complexity: O(1)
Description: Insertion Sort builds the sorted array one element at a time by repeatedly inserting the next element into the correct position.

- Tree Sort
Time Complexity: O(n log n)
Space Complexity: O(n)
Description: Tree Sort inserts the elements into a binary search tree and then performs an in-order traversal to get the elements in sorted order.
